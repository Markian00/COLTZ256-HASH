# COLTZ256-HASH
Creating a cryptographic hash function leveraging the properties of the unsolved Collatz Conjecture. This was an idea I had in my EECS376 (Computer Science Theory) class. It's only appropriate that I write a proof, so the whitepaper proving the algorithm's security will be added here shortly.
